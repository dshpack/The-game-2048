# The-game-2048
2048 video game

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.

2048 is played on a gray 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four hotkeys W A S D.
